# About
This mod allows you to connect intimate toys to PEAK using Buttplug.io!

It will make your device vibrate when:
- Your maximum stamina is reduced (taking damage, being cold, etc.).
- You have no stamina left (even if you have some extra stamina).

You can configure which effects cause vibration, how long, and how strongly with the BepInEx Configuration file.
This mod is client-side and can be used online without requiring other players to have it.

# Instructions
- Download and install Intiface Central: https://intiface.com/central/
- Click the big play button to start the Intiface communication and click Start Scanning in the Devices tab to find your devices.
- If needed see the Intiface quickstart guide to set up your Devices: https://docs.intiface.com/docs/intiface-central/quickstart
- Start the game with the mod installed.
- The mod will only include devices already connected when the game starts: you will need to restart the game if your device has been added later.
- You can test the mod by running until you're out of stamina.

# Compatibility
- Check the [buttplug.io compatibility list](https://iostindex.com/?filter0Availability=Available,DIY&filter1Connection=Digital) to see if your toy works with the mod.
- Intiface is also compatible with XBOX controllers. So you can have normal vibrations, too
- The mod should not interfere with other mods and can be used with anything.
